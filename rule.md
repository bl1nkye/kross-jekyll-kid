# Project Rules and Purpose

## Main Purpose
This website exists so my son and his friends can publish blog posts together in a simple, safe, and fun way.

## Core Posting Rule
All blog posts must be submitted through the shared Google Form and then published via the automated Google Script + webhook workflow (no manual edits to `_posts/` unless explicitly approved).

## Ongoing Maintenance Rule
Keep `codex_log.md` up to date with clear, step-by-step notes whenever changes are made, so the project history is easy to learn from.

## Future Work Rule
Any future building or modifications should preserve the automated submission workflow and keep the project kid-friendly, low-maintenance, and easy to understand.
